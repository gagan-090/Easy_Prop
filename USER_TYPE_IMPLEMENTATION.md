# User Type Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the "Who" field in the registration form, allowing users to select between "Agent" and "Owner" roles. The implementation includes database updates, form modifications, and dashboard customizations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### File: `migration/supabase-schema.sql`
- Added `user_type` column to the users table
- Set default value as 'agent'
- Added CHECK constraint to ensure only 'agent' or 'owner' values are allowed

```sql
user_type TEXT DEFAULT 'agent' CHECK (user_type IN ('agent', 'owner'))
```

#### File: `migration/add-user-type-column.sql`
- Migration script for existing databases
- Safely adds the user_type column if it doesn't exist
- Updates existing users with default 'agent' type

### 2. Registration Form Updates

#### File: `src/pages/Auth/Register.jsx`
- Added `userType` field to the validation schema using Yup
- Added dropdown field in the form with "Agent" and "Owner" options
- Positioned between name field and email/OTP fields
- Includes proper error handling and validation messages

**New Field:**
```jsx
<select id="userType" {...register("userType")}>
  <option value="">Select your role</option>
  <option value="agent">Agent</option>
  <option value="owner">Owner</option>
</select>
```

### 3. Authentication Context Updates

#### File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Modified `registerWithEmailOTP` function to include userType
- Updated user profile creation to include user_type
- Enhanced user data fetching to include userType from Supabase

### 4. Supabase Service Updates

#### File: `src/services/supabaseService.js`
- Updated `createUserProfile` function to handle user_type field
- Modified existing user creation in `addProperty` to include default user_type
- Ensured backward compatibility for existing users

### 5. Dashboard Customization

#### File: `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx`
- Added user type display in all user profile sections
- Shows user type as a blue badge below email
- Appears in mobile sidebar, desktop sidebar, and profile dropdown

#### File: `src/components/DashboardStats.jsx`
- Customized dashboard statistics based on user type
- Different labels for Agent vs Owner:
  - Agent: "Properties for Sale", "Properties for Rent", "Total Customers", "Total Cities"
  - Owner: "My Properties for Sale", "My Properties for Rent", "Total Inquiries", "Property Views"

## User Experience

### For New Users
1. During registration, users must select their role (Agent or Owner)
2. The field is required and validates properly
3. User type is stored in the database and displayed throughout the app

### For Existing Users
1. Existing users are automatically assigned "Agent" type
2. They can update their type through profile settings (if implemented)
3. No disruption to existing functionality

### Dashboard Differences

#### Agent Dashboard
- Focus on business metrics (customers, cities, properties)
- Professional real estate agent perspective
- Emphasis on portfolio management

#### Owner Dashboard  
- Focus on property-specific metrics (inquiries, views)
- Property owner perspective
- Emphasis on individual property performance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Validation Schema
```javascript
userType: yup
  .string()
  .required("Please select your role")
  .oneOf(["agent", "owner"], "Please select either Agent or Owner")
```

### Database Constraint
```sql
CHECK (user_type IN ('agent', 'owner'))
```

### Form Field Styling
- Consistent with existing form design
- Proper error states and validation
- Accessible dropdown with clear options

## Testing

### Test File: `test-user-type.js`
- Validates data structure
- Tests user type options
- Verifies dashboard customization logic
- Confirms implementation completeness

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Registration form shows user type dropdown
- [ ] Form validation works for user type field
- [ ] User type is saved to database
- [ ] Dashboard displays user type correctly
- [ ] Dashboard stats are customized based on user type
- [ ] Existing users can still log in and function normally

## Migration Steps

1. **Update Database Schema:**
   ```sql
   -- Run the migration script
   \i migration/add-user-type-column.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend Changes:**
   - All frontend changes are backward compatible
   - No breaking changes for existing users

3. **Verify Implementation:**
   ```bash
   node test-user-type.js
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Profile Settings:** Allow users to change their type after registration
2. **Role-Based Features:** Implement different features based on user type
3. **Analytics:** Track user type distribution and behavior
4. **Permissions:** Add role-based access control if needed
