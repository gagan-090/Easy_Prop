# User Type Fix Guide

## Problem Description
When a new user registers with "owner" profile, the dashboard shows "agent" instead of "owner".

## Root Cause
The issue was in the timing between user registration and profile fetching in the `AuthContext.jsx`. When a user registers:

1. User selects "owner" during registration
2. Profile is created in Supabase with `user_type: 'owner'`
3. `onAuthStateChanged` listener is triggered
4. Profile fetching might fail initially due to timing
5. System falls back to default "agent" type

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Temporary User Type Storage
- Store the user type in localStorage during registration
- Use this temporary value if profile fetching fails
- Clean up the temporary value after use

### 2. Enhanced Profile Fetching
- Added retry mechanism for profile fetching
- Better error handling and logging
- Fallback to temporary user type for new registrations

### 3. Improved Debugging
- Added comprehensive console logging
- Enhanced error messages
- Better user feedback

## Code Changes Made

### AuthContext.jsx Changes:
1. **Registration Process**: Store user type in localStorage
2. **Auth State Listener**: Check for temporary user type if profile not found
3. **Logout**: Clean up temporary user type
4. **Profile Fetching**: Added retry mechanism

### Key Changes:
```javascript
// During registration
localStorage.setItem('temp_user_type', userType);

// During auth state change
const tempUserType = localStorage.getItem('temp_user_type');
if (tempUserType) {
  userData.userType = tempUserType;
  localStorage.removeItem('temp_user_type');
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Test New Registration
1. Open the application in a new browser session
2. Go to registration page
3. Fill in the form and select "Owner" in the dropdown
4. Complete the registration process
5. Check the dashboard - it should show "Owner" instead of "Agent"

### Step 2: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for these messages:
   - `ðŸ’¾ Stored temporary user type: owner`
   - `ðŸŽ¯ Found temporary user type for new user: owner`
   - `âœ… User type set from temp storage: owner`

### Step 3: Use Debug Component
1. The dashboard shows a yellow debug box
2. Check if "User Type" shows "owner"
3. If not, use the "Set as Owner" button
4. Click "Refresh User Data"

### Step 4: Test Database
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check your user data
SELECT id, email, name, user_type, created_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## Expected Behavior

### For New Users (Registration):
1. User selects "Owner" during registration
2. User type is stored temporarily
3. Profile is created in database with `user_type: 'owner'`
4. Dashboard shows "Owner" and owner-specific stats

### For Existing Users (Login):
1. User logs in with existing account
2. System fetches profile from database
3. User type is loaded from database
4. Dashboard shows correct user type

### Dashboard Differences:
- **Owner**: "My Properties for Sale", "My Properties for Rent", "Total Inquiries", "Property Views"
- **Agent**: "Properties for Sale", "Properties for Rent", "Total Customers", "Total Cities"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still Shows "Agent"
**Check:**
1. Console logs for error messages
2. Database for correct user_type value
3. Debug component for current user data

**Solution:**
1. Use debug component to manually set user type
2. Check if database update was successful
3. Try logging out and logging back in

### Issue 2: Temporary User Type Not Working
**Check:**
1. Console for `ðŸ’¾ Stored temporary user type` message
2. localStorage for `temp_user_type` value

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache and try again
2. Check if localStorage is enabled
3. Verify registration process completes successfully

### Issue 3: Database Issues
**Check:**
1. Supabase connection
2. User table structure
3. RLS policies

**Solution:**
1. Run database migration if needed
2. Check Supabase logs
3. Verify table permissions

## Verification Steps

### 1. Registration Test
```javascript
// Run this in browser console to test
localStorage.setItem('temp_user_type', 'owner');
console.log('Stored:', localStorage.getItem('temp_user_type'));
```

### 2. Profile Fetching Test
```javascript
// Test the retry mechanism
// This should be handled automatically by the code
```

### 3. User Type Assignment Test
```javascript
// Test user type assignment logic
const userData = { uid: 'test', email: 'test@example.com' };
const tempUserType = localStorage.getItem('temp_user_type');
userData.userType = tempUserType || 'agent';
console.log('User type:', userData.userType);
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx**
   - Added temporary user type storage
   - Enhanced profile fetching with retry
   - Improved error handling

2. **test-user-type-fix.js** (new)
   - Test script for verification

3. **USER_TYPE_FIX_GUIDE.md** (new)
   - This comprehensive guide

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** with new user registration
2. **Verify existing users** still work correctly
3. **Monitor console logs** for any issues
4. **Remove debug component** once confirmed working
5. **Update documentation** if needed

## Success Criteria

âœ… New users registering as "Owner" see "Owner" in dashboard
âœ… Existing users maintain their correct user type
âœ… Console shows proper debug messages
âœ… Database contains correct user_type values
âœ… Dashboard stats change based on user type

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Remove the localStorage temporary user type logic
2. Revert to the previous profile fetching approach
3. Use the debug component for manual user type updates
4. Check database for correct values

The fix is designed to be backward compatible and should not affect existing functionality.
